        Our hearing test was doing well, more than a million people had
        downloaded the app by now.

        The main metric for this product was
        <span class="underline">completed tests</span>. They're worth measuring
        because they equate to the core value for the user, but also because
        they generate data to further improve our algorithms.

        Despite the large number of downloads, not everyone started a hearing
        test. Analyzing the funnel, I discovered that the biggest bottleneck had
        become the noise meter. This was a feature that we built in to increase
        the accuracy of the test. The accuracy goes down when it's noisy in the
        environment the user is doing a hearing test in.

        Clearly the biggest drop-off was between the intro and the noise meter.
        The events below are triggered when the user finished a certain step.
        E.g. <span class="font-mono font-bold">98%</span>
        <span class="italic"> "finished the introduction"</span>, and (only)
        <span class="font-mono font-bold">84%</span>
        <span class="italic"> "finished the noise meter"</span>.
