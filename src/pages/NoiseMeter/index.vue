        because they equate to the core value for the user, but also because
        they generate data to further improve our algorithms.

        Despite the large number of downloads, not everyone started a hearing
        test. Analyzing the funnel, I discovered that the biggest bottleneck had
        become the noise meter. This was a feature that we built in to increase
        the accuracy of the test. The accuracy goes down when it's noisy in the
        environment the user is doing a hearing test in.

        Clearly the biggest drop-off was between the intro and the noise meter.

          <li class="mb-2">
            Either there was no problem, because the big button would just allow

            continue, because the button was disabled (it was too loud).

        </ol>
        Although this also makes clear why a user test is not always perfect
        (people behave differently in a test setting). A real problem in the
        latter case was that the users didn't seem to feel the agency to change

            Where's previously the loud range included both 'some noise' and

            Instead of a binary 'good / bad' indicator, we made the noise around

            loud or a continuous background sound that caused the problem.

            result that it was done in a noisy environment. Balancing the need
            for accuracy.

            Note that we only showed this warning if the environment wasn't

            Not all noise is created equal, and if you have bad hearing some of
            it doesn't matter. Technically we would have been able to measure
            whether the noise that we registered during the test actually had an
            impact on your hearing. To explain why I'd have to go deeply into
